# multiagent_research-lab
This repository contains a simulation of a multi-agent research collaboration where autonomous AI agents gather, analyze, and synthesize information about an AI-related topic using open-source frameworks and the Hugging Face Inference API. Each agent acts as part of a “virtual research lab” working to produce a coherent research summary.
